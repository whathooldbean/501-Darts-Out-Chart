# 501-Darts-Out-Chart
Welcome to 501 Out Chart!

While there are plenty of 501/301 Out Charts out there these days, two things seemed to be lacking to me:
1. They always give the “most efficient” way to go out.  However, often there are equally efficient ways 
   to go out. This program shows every possible way to go out.
2. This may be a personal preference of mine, but I always like to go out on a 2^n. This way, if I miss 
   the double and hit the single, I can always use my next turn to go out on 2^(n-1).  This program 
   prioritizes its results to put these at the top of the list if there are any.
3. It can help strategize future throws should a miss occur.   

Coming soon:
• A GUI.
• A Scorer Program that will all you to enter in the enter in your turn’s score and in return the program
  will keep both players’ scores and list the possible outs below each player.
